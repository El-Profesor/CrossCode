[X] Global traces
[X] Animations
[ ] How to deal with traces that show on the same state but at multiple points in time
[ ] Animations should be derived from branches not a heuristic
[ ] Trace should be automatically shown when animation is played (global & local)
[ ] Traces should fade out over time after playing
[ ] Build tree structure for recursive call
[ ] User interactions for what they want to see
[ ] Two different models: look at data, look at events, looking at source code
[ ] Live programming
[ ] Hover to show trace
[ ] Animations for trace
[ ] Source code as label
[ ] Tree view
[ ] Peak into queries
[ ] Routes
[ ] Routes should be expandable, collapsible.
[ ] Collapse (abstract) over space
[ ] Collapse (abstract) over trace operations
[ ] Combine into chunks, let user expand to lower level operations if they want
[ ] If layout is different can't attach trace to post / pre renderers :(
[ ] Animation UI
[ ] Replay, seek, pause animation
[ ] Objects
[ ] References
[ ] Linked List example
[ ] Multiple references to same object overlap
[ ] Passive writes view
[ ] Code selection and queries
[ ] Temporary queries from code
[ ] Fix normal queries
[ ] Traces for control flow
[ ] Different types of trace: additions, deletions of data
[ ] Polish animations
[ ] Polish traces
[ ] Methods
[ ] Logical operator trace
[ ] Global animations
[ ] Second layer on top
[ ] Search and filter
[ ] Crossroads
[ ] Just find the same animation node
[ ] Fix traces only going from times they were modified
[ ] Can be done in post
[ ] Combine code selections into one
[ ] Cleanup mouse bindings
[ ] Hide reads until expanded - global trace should not show extraneous data
[ ] Select things that are there instead of always temp'ing
[ ] Max depth doesn't update so connections look out of place
[ ] Good defaults
[ ] Unexecuted control flow.
[ ] Maintaining continuity with traces when changing structure.
[ ] Specialized representations.
[ ] Out not at correct place if multiple temporary values
