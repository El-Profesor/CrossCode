# CrossCode

Note: this is an experimental research prototype that is being actively developed. It may not work as expected. It supports a limited subset of JavaScript with constants, function calls and definitions, binary operators, let-bindings, if-statements, and for-loops.

## Setup instructions
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

## Using the tool
1. The default source code file that is loaded is under `./public/default.js`.
2. Sample tutorial code snippets are under the `./tutorials` folder.
